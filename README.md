## 🎵 Project Details

Our project utilizes Machine Learning algorithms to analyze user music preferences and recommend similar tracks based on historical data. By implementing K-means clustering, we group songs with similar features and provide personalized recommendations to users.

### 📊 Implementation

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the Spotify dataset for model training.
- **Model Training:** Applying Machine Learning algorithms to create accurate music recommendations.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the recommendation system using various metrics.

## 📈 Results

Through our experiments, we have achieved significant improvements in recommendation accuracy compared to traditional methods. Users can now discover new music tailored to their tastes with enhanced precision.

## 🌟 Future Enhancements

As we continue to develop the Spotify Music Recommender, we aim to incorporate advanced algorithms and user feedback mechanisms for further enhancing the recommendation system's performance.
